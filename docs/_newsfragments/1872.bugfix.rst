:attr:`falcon.Uri.encode` and :attr:`falcon.Uri.encode_value` now escape all
percent characters by default even if it appears they have already been escaped. 
The :attr:`falcon.Uri.encode_check_escaped` and :attr:`falcon.Uri.encode_value_check_escaped` 
methods have been added to give the option of retaining the previous behavior where needed. 
These new methods have been applied to the :attr:`falcon.Response.location`, 
:attr:`falcon.Response.content_location`, :attr:`falcon.Response.append_link` 
attrs and methods to retain previous behavior.
